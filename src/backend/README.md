# Schedule-maker-api

This uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)'s authentication and database apis. They provide an easy way to manage authentication and authorization.

## Note

The code does not include the details to connect to the firebase (for obvious security reasons). If you wish to use it, email me at vincentmingli@gmail.com and we can talk this over.
