# John Abbott College mock schedule maker (deprecated)

Inspired by [William Li](https://github.com/willi-li-am)'s John Abbott College mock [schedule maker](https://github.com/willi-li-am/jac-schedule), I decided to make my own to learn about pdf parsing and web scraping, as well as refresh my skills with Python.

Completed:

- PDF parser
- Web scraper
- Course Searching Feature
- Schedule Grid (view)
- Adding courses
- Saving schedules into local storage (bottom section)
- A mobile-friendly version (not recommended on mobile because the website may be slow)
- An account creation feature
- A home page
- A forgot password feature
- Some autocomplete features

Todo:

- A tutorial
- A 3D background for home page
