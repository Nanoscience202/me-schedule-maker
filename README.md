# John Abbott College mock schedule maker

Inspired by [William Li](https://github.com/Trollermaner)'s John Abbott College mock [schedule maker](https://github.com/Trollermaner/schedule-maker), I decided to make my own to learn about pdf parsing and web scraping, as well as refresh my skills with Python.

Completed:
* PDF parser
* Web scraper
* Course Searching Feature
* Schedule Grid (view)
* Adding courses
* Saving schedules into local storage (bottom section)

Todo:
* Maybe some autocomplete features
* Maybe an account creation feature
* A tutorial
